# Brainfuck
Brainfuck interpreter written in C.

## What is Brainfuck?

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. It is designed to challenge and amuse programmers, and was not made to be suitable for practical use.

Brainfuck uses a simple machine model consisting of an infinite tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero, and a pointer to the current cell. The language has only eight commands, which are each represented by a single character. These commands can be used to manipulate the memory cells and the pointer, and to perform input and output.

Brainfuck is often used as a test of a person's ability to write a language interpreter or a compiler. It is considered a "minimalistic" language, as it has a very small set of commands and is not intended for practical use.

### Commands:

The eight language commands each consist of a single character: 

| Command         | Meaning                                                                 | C equivalent                             |
|:---------------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| (Program Start) |                                                                         | char data[30000] = {0}; char ptr = data; |
| `>`             | Increment the data pointer.                                             | `++ptr;`                                 |
| `<`             | Decrement the data pointer.                                             | `--ptr;`                                 |
| `+`             | Increment the byte at the data pointer.                                 | `++*ptr;`                                |
| `-`             | Decrement the byte at the data pointer.                                 | `--*ptr;`                                |
| `.`             | Output the byte at the data pointer.                                    | `putchar(*ptr);`                         |
| `,`             | Input a byte and store it at the data pointer.                          | `*ptr = getchar();`                      |
| `[`             | If the byte at the data pointer is 0, jump to the corresponding ']'     | `while (*ptr) {`                         |
| `]`             | If the byte at the data pointer is not 0, jump to the corresponding '[' | `}`                                      |

## Usage
	Usage: brainfuck [OPTIONS] [FILE/-e CODE]

	Interpret brainfuck code by passing the file or the code itself.

	Available options:
	  -h, --help          Show this help message.
	  -v, --version       Show the program version.
	  -o, --output FILE   Write output to FILE.
	  -e, --execute CODE  Execute the code specified by CODE.

Show help menu without giving any arguments.

## Output:
Prints the result of the program and the time in which it was execute:

	Hello World!
	
	The program took 0.000000 seconds to execute.

### Error handling:
The interpreter has error handling, it prints the path to the file and the character where the error occurred and below the error message.

	File "hello.bf", char 108
	Error: Byte overflow (256).

## Getting the source
Download the source code by running the following code in your command prompt:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jsob0/brainfuck.git
```
or simply [grab](https://github.com/jsob0/brainfuck/archive/main.zip) a copy of the source code as a Zip file.

## Building
Create the build directory.
```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```
Brainfuck requires CMake and a C compiler (e.g. Clang or GCC) in order to run.
Then, simply create the Makefiles:
```sh
$ cmake ..
```
and finally, build it using the building system you chose (e.g. Make):
```sh
$ make
```
Run the interpreter by specifying the file path or its code.
```sh
$ ./brainfuck -o hello.txt hello.bf
$ ./brainfuck -e "-[------->+<]>-.-[->+++++<]>++.+++++++..+++.[--->+<]>----."
```
