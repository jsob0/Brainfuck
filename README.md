# Brainfuck
Brainfuck interpreter written in C.

## What is Brainfuck?

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. It is designed to challenge and amuse programmers, and was not made to be suitable for practical use.

Brainfuck uses a simple machine model consisting of an infinite tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero, and a pointer to the current cell. The language has only eight commands, which are each represented by a single character. These commands can be used to manipulate the memory cells and the pointer, and to perform input and output.

Brainfuck is often used as a test of a person's ability to write a language interpreter or a compiler. It is considered a "minimalistic" language, as it has a very small set of commands and is not intended for practical use.

### Commands:

The eight language commands each consist of a single character: 

| Character   | Meaning                                                                 |
|:-----------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `>`         | Increment the data pointer.                                             |
| `<`         | Decrement the data pointer.                                             |
| `+`         | Increment the byte at the data pointer.                                 |
| `-`         | Decrement the byte at the data pointer.                                 |
| `.`         | Output the byte at the data pointer.                                    |
| `,`         | Input a byte and store it at the data pointer.                          |
| `[`         | If the byte at the data pointer is 0, jump to the corresponding ']'     |
| `]`         | If the byte at the data pointer is not 0, jump to the corresponding '[' |

## Building:
#### To get started, clone the repository and compile the source code:

Download the source code by running the following code in your command prompt:

	git clone https://github.com/jsob0/brainfuck.git

or simply [grab](https://github.com/jsob0/brainfuck/archive/master.zip) a copy of the source code as a Zip file.
	
	cd brainfuck
	gcc brainfuck.c -o brainfuck

## Usage

	./brainfuck [-vh] <source file>
	-v --version    show interpreter version.
	-h --help       show help menu.
	
Show help menu without giving any arguments.

## Output:
Prints the result of the program and the time in which it was execute:

	Hello World!
	
	The program took 0.001000 seconds to execute.

## Error handling:
The interpreter has error handling:

	File "hello.bf", char 108
	Error: Byte overflow (256).

has support for most commands:

| Character   | Exception                           |
|:-----------:|-------------------------------------|
| `>`         | Pointer index out of range (30001). |
| `<`         | Pointer index out of range (-1).    |
| `+`         | Byte overflow (256).                |
| `-`         | Byte overflow (-1).                 |
| `.`         | -                                   |
| `,`         | -                                   |
| `[`         | End of loop not found.              |
| `]`         | Start of loop not found.            |
